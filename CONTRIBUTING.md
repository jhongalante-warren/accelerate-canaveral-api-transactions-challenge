# Contributing

This project is a template for all API services, therefore, we must know that
all changes here will probably impact on new services. That said, we must be
extra careful on installing new packages and/or changing stuff around.

Some advices before contributing to this project:

- If your changes are too specific (and will work only in a few projects),
  it's probably a better idea to create a
  [package](https://github.com/warrenbrasil/npm-packages) and use it in your
  projects.

- When introducing a new dependency, check if the project is well maintained.

- Make sure to document all contributions, when adding a new configuration,
  document how to enable it and what are the effects of doing do.

## How to submit your contribution

It's relatively easy to submit your contribution. You just need to open a
Pull Request with a good description and you're good to go. There's a little
checklist that may help you:

- Your Pull Request has a good and descriptive title
- Your Pull Request has a good description that explains how the changes
  modify the template, making sure all decisions that affect people using the
  template are well documented
